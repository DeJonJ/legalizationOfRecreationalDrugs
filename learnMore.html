        <h2 class="argument-title">Opposition of Drug Legalization</h2>
        <p class="argument-content">
          While there are various arguments against drug legalization, some of the common concerns include:
        </p>
        <p class="argument-content">
          <strong>1. Public Health Risks:</strong> Opponents argue that legalizing drugs could lead to increased substance abuse, addiction rates, and related health problems. They claim that the availability and accessibility of drugs would have a detrimental impact on public health.
        </p>
        <p class="argument-content">
          <strong>2. Societal Impact:</strong> Critics contend that drug legalization could lead to increased crime rates, violence, and social instability. They argue that the legal drug market might create an environment conducive to drug trafficking, organized crime, and related societal issues.
        </p>
        <p class="argument-content">
          <strong>3. Economic Burden:</strong> Some argue that legalizing drugs could place a significant economic burden on society. They claim that the costs associated with addiction treatment, healthcare, and rehabilitation services could outweigh any potential benefits from drug legalization.
        </p>
        <p class="argument-content">
          <strong>4. Gateway Theory:</strong> Opponents suggest that drug legalization could act as a gateway to more dangerous substances. They argue that legalizing less harmful drugs could increase the likelihood of individuals experimenting with more potent and harmful drugs.

        <h2 class="argument-title">Arguments for Legalization</h2>
        <p class="argument-content">
          The legalization of drugs, as demonstrated by the case of Portugal, presents compelling arguments in favor of a new approach to drug policy. Here are some key reasons supporting drug legalization:
        </p>
        <p class="argument-content">
          <strong>1. Public Health and Harm Reduction:</strong> Portugal's decriminalization of drugs in 2001 led to a significant shift towards a public health and harm reduction approach. By treating drug addiction as a health issue rather than a criminal offense, individuals have greater access to treatment, counseling, and support services. This approach has resulted in reduced rates of drug-related deaths, HIV infections, and drug-related crimes.
        </p>
        <p class="argument-content">
          <strong>2. Reduced Drug Use and Addiction Rates:</strong> Contrary to concerns about increased drug use, Portugal's drug policy overhaul has actually led to a decrease in drug consumption rates, particularly among young people. The focus on prevention, education, and treatment programs has helped individuals make more informed decisions about drug use and seek assistance when needed.
        </p>
        <p class="argument-content">
          <strong>3. Disruption of Organized Crime:</strong> Legalizing drugs disrupts the black market and reduces the power of organized crime groups involved in drug trafficking. By removing the illegal drug trade, law enforcement resources can be redirected towards addressing other societal issues and reducing violence associated with the illegal drug market.
        </p>
        <p class="argument-content">
          <strong>4. Economic Benefits:</strong> The legalization of drugs can bring substantial economic benefits. Portugal has seen positive economic outcomes, including job creation in the legal drug industry, increased tax revenue, and a reduction in the costs associated with drug enforcement and incarceration. These economic benefits can be used to fund education, treatment, and harm reduction programs.
        </p>
        <p class="argument-content">
          <strong>5. Personal Freedom and Individual Rights:</strong> Legalizing drugs aligns with the principles of personal freedom and individual rights. It allows individuals to make their own choices regarding drug use, provided they do not harm others. Drug use becomes a matter of personal responsibility, and individuals can seek help without fear of criminal consequences.
        </p>
        <p class="argument-content">
          The Portuguese example serves as a valuable case study, demonstrating that drug legalization can lead to positive outcomes in terms of public health, reduced drug use, disruption of organized crime, economic benefits, and the preservation of personal freedom and individual rights.
